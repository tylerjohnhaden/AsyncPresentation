## Jellybean Experiment

I will be running the jellybeans.go server during the 
presentation. Try to guess the 'number of jellybeans in the 
jar' by sending a get request to `:7777/{int:guess}` 
where `0 <= guess <= 2 ** 21`. Every time someone guesses the right
number of jellybeans, the number reshuffles, and I will reward you 
with jellybeans.
